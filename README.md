# Stockmarket-analysis
# Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of historical daily stock prices for all tickers currently trading on NASDAQ, retrieved from Yahoo Finance. The goal is to conduct in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends, price movements, and trading volumes of various stocks and ETFs. The data analysis will provide insights into the market's behavior and could serve as a foundation for further financial modeling and forecasting.

# Project Goals
## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, formatting dates, and adjusting price data for splits and dividends.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovering trends, price movements, and relationships between variables like open, close, and volume across different tickers.
Visualization: Creating insightful visual representations of stock price movements and trends over time.
Statistical Analysis: Analyzing key statistics such as moving averages, volatility, and correlations between stocks and market indices.
Predictive Modeling (Optional/Future Work): Building potential models for stock price forecasting.
# Dataset
The dataset consists of historical daily stock prices for NASDAQ tickers, including stocks and ETFs. Data was collected using the yfinance Python package and contains prices up to April 1, 2020. The data is organized in CSV files, one per ticker, and includes:

Date: The trading date.
Open: The opening price of the stock.
High: The highest price of the stock during the trading day.
Low: The lowest price of the stock during the trading day.
Close: The closing price adjusted for splits.
Adj Close: Adjusted close price for both dividends and splits.
Volume: The number of shares traded during the day.
Additional metadata for each ticker is available in symbols_valid_meta.csv.

# Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

# Data Collection:

Data is retrieved from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance Python package.
Additional scripts are provided for updating the dataset if needed.
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing data and formatting columns.
Adjusting prices for splits and dividends.
Organizing the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Statistical summaries of price movements (mean, median, standard deviation).
Time-series analysis of stock prices.
Visualizations (line plots, histograms, box plots) to reveal trends and anomalies.
Data Visualization:

Visualization tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly are used to create:
Price trend charts.
Moving averages.
Trading volumes across various tickers.
# Statistical Analysis:

Volatility and risk metrics for different stocks.
Correlation analysis between different tickers.
Seasonal trends or cyclic patterns in stock prices.
Predictive Modeling (Optional):

Setting up potential predictive models for stock prices using time-series forecasting techniques such as ARIMA or machine learning models.
# Requirements
The project requires the following libraries and dependencies:

Python 3.x
Pandas: For data manipulation.
Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly: For data visualization.
yfinance: For retrieving historical stock data.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Scikit-learn (optional): For machine learning models if any forecasting is conducted.
